# Architecture Plan

## 1. Introduction

*   Brief overview of the project and its purpose.
*   High-level architecture diagram.
*   Target audience and document scope.

## 2. Architecture Overview

*   Microservice architecture principles.
*   Service responsibilities and boundaries.
*   Technology stack: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Postgres, Eureka, Nginx, Spring Cloud Config Server, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Kubernetes.
*   Diagram illustrating the microservice architecture.

## 3. Service Details

*   Detailed description of each microservice:
    *   Name and responsibility.
    *   API endpoints.
    *   Data model.
    *   Dependencies.
    *   Configuration.
    *   Example code snippets.
*   Accounts service
*   Products service
*   Orders service
*   Payment service
*   Inventory service
*   ... (other services)

## 4. Inter-service Communication

*   RESTful API design principles.
*   Communication patterns: synchronous vs. asynchronous.
*   API Gateway (Nginx) configuration and routing.
*   Example API calls between services.
*   Diagram illustrating inter-service communication.

## 5. Data Management

*   Data persistence strategies: MySQL, Postgres.
*   Data consistency and transaction management.
*   Data partitioning and sharding.
*   Database schema design.
*   Data backup and recovery.

## 6. Deployment Considerations

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

*   Monitoring with Prometheus.
*   Visualization with Grafana.
*   Log aggregation and analysis with Loki.
*   Alerting and notifications.
*   Example Grafana dashboards.

## 8. Scaling Strategies

*   Horizontal scaling based on CPU usage.
*   Auto-scaling configuration in Kubernetes.
*   Load balancing strategies.
*   Performance tuning and optimization.

## 9. CI/CD Pipelines

*   Overview of the CI/CD process.
*   Tools and technologies used: Jenkins.
*   Pipeline stages: build, test, deploy.
*   Automated testing strategies.
